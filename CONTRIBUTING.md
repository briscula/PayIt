# Contributing

It's really easy: You just need to create an issue so we can discuss about the changes you wanna made and then, 
create a pull request with all commits following the [Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines).

We use semantic-release, so you don't need to update the version, it will be done automatically.
